# Haunted Mansion
A python project showing a simple text-adventure style programme. 

At this stage, there is a simple layout of a mansions ground floor for the player to traverse throughout. This is nothing more than a prototype at this point with bare-bones descriptions indicating which room the player is currently in.

## To Run:
Open the file in your Python Shell, and then 'run' the module to test the program.

## How to Play:
When you enter a room, you have a few written options (More to be added in future commits):
* **N** or **North** to travel North.
* **E** or **East** to travel East.
* **S** or **South** to travel South.
* **W** or **West** to travel West.
* **Q** or **Quit** to exit the application.
